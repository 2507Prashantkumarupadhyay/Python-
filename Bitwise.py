# Bitwise Operators:
"""
1.Bitwise Operators act on bits and perform the bit-by-bit operations.
2.These are used to operate on binary number .

"""

# Examples of Bitwise operators
a = 10
b = 4

# Print bitwise AND operation
print(a & b)

# Print bitwise OR operation
print(a | b)

# Print bitwise NOT operation
print(~a)

# print bitwise XOR operation
print(a ^ b)

# print bitwise right shift operation
print(a >> 2)

# print bitwise left shift operation
print(a << 2)
